Crosstalk between CD4(+) T cells and proliferating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) tumor B cells occurs within lymphoid tissue pseudo-follicles and investigating these interactions is essential to understand both disease pathogenesis and the effects of immunotherapy. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV) shedding is emerging as an important mode of intercellular communication in the TME. In order to characterize tumor EVs released in response to T cell-derived TME signals, we performed microRNA (miR) profiling of EVs released from CLL cells stimulated with CD40 and IL-4. Our results reveal an enrichment of specific cellular miRNAs including miR-363 within EVs derived from CD40/IL-4 stimulated CLL cells compared to parental cell miRNA content and control EVs from unstimulated CLL cells. We demonstrate that autologous patient CD4(+) T cells internalize CLL-EVs containing miR-363 that targets the immunomodulatory molecule CD69. We further reveal that autologous CD4(+) T cells that are exposed to EVs from CD40/IL-4 stimulated CLL cells exhibit enhanced migration, immunological synapse signaling and interactions with tumor cells. Knockdown of miR-363 in CLL cells prior to CD40/IL-4 stimulation, prevented the ability of CLL-EVs to induce increased synapse signaling and confer altered functional properties to CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, these data reveal a novel role for CLL-EVs in modifying T cell function that highlights unanticipated complexity of intercellular communication that may have implications for bidirectional CD4(+) T-cell:tumor interactions within the TME.Peer-reviewedPost-prin","identifiers":["oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381/37511","10.1182/blood-2015-11-682377"],"journals":[{"title":null,"identifiers":["issn:1528-0020","1528-0020"]}],"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"publisher":"American Society of Hematology","relations":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27118451"],"repositories":[{"id":"63","openDoarId":0,"name":"Leicester Research Archive","uri":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"metadataRecordCount":0,"metadataDeletedRecordCount":0,"metadataLinkCount":0,"metadataSize":0,"journalMetadataSize":0,"metadataAge":null,"journalMetadataAge":null,"metadataInIndexCount":0,"metadataDeletedInIndexCount":0,"metadataAlloweInIndexCount":0,"metadataDisabledInIndexCount":0,"metadataExtractionDate":null,"journalMetadataExtractionDate":null,"databaseRecordCount":0,"databaseDeletedRecordCount":0,"databasePdfLinkCount":0,"databasePdfCount":0,"databaseDeletedPdfCount":0,"hardDrivePdfSize":0,"hardDrivePdfCount":0,"hardDriveDeletedPdfCount":0,"databaseTextCount":0,"databaseTextNotDeletedCount":0,"hardDriveTextCount":0,"hardDriveDeletedTextCount":0,"databaseIndexCount":0,"indexRecordCount":0,"indexJournalCount":0,"indexTextCount":0,"metadataOnlyIndex":0,"indexTextCountDB":0,"indexedPdfDB":0,"indexedDisabledDB":0,"indexTextNotDeletedCount":0,"hardDriveCitationFiles":0,"citationFilesDb":0,"crawlingLimit":0,"citationCount":0,"citationWithDocCount":0,"citationDoiCount":0,"documentDoiCount":0,"documentDoiWithFulltextCount":0,"repositoryLocation":null}],"subjects":["Journal Article","JOURNAL ARTICLE"],"title":"Extracellular vesicles released by CD40/IL-4 stimulated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells confer altered functional properties to CD4+ T cells","topics":[],"types":[],"year":2016,"fulltextUrls":["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42022689.pdf","https://core.ac.uk/display/42022689","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27118451","http://hdl.handle.net/2381/37511","http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/early/2016/04/26/blood-2015-11-682377?sso-checked=true"],"fulltextIdentifier":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42022689.pdf","doi":"10.1182/blood-2015-11-682377","oai":"oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381/37511"},{"id":"41991632","authors":["Fischer, Anika","Zundler, Sebastian","Atreya, Raja","Rath, Timo","Voskens, Caroline","Hirschmann, Simon","López-Posadas, Rocío","Watson, Alastair","Becker, Christoph","Schuler, Gerold","Neufert, Clemens","Atreya, Imke","Neurath, Markus F."],"contributors":[],"datePublished":"2016-10","description":"Objective: Gut homing of lymphocytes via adhesion molecules has recently emerged as new target for therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases. We aimed to analyze the in vivo homing of effector (Teff) and regulatory (Treg) T cells to the inflamed gut via α4β7 and GPR15. Design: We assessed the expression of homing receptors on T cells in peripheral blood and inflamed mucosa. We studied the migration pattern and homing of Teff and Treg cells to the inflamed gut using intravital confocal microscopy and FACS in a humanized mouse model in DSS-treated NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid-Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) mice. Results: Expression of GPR15 and α4β7 was significantly increased on Treg rather than Teff cells in peripheral blood of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) as compared to Crohn´s disease and controls. In vivo analysis in a humanized mouse model showed augmented gut homing of UC Treg cells as compared to controls. Moreover, suppression of UC (but not control) Teff and Treg cell homing was noted upon treatment with the α4β7 antibody vedolizumab. In contrast, siRNA blockade of GPR15 had only effects on homing of Teff cells but did not affect Treg homing in UC. Clinical vedolizumab treatment was associated with marked expansion of UC Treg cells in peripheral blood. Conclusion: α4β7 rather than GPR15 is crucial for increased colonic homing of UC Treg cells in vivo, while both receptors control UC Teff homing. Vedolizumab treatment impairs homing of UC Treg cells leading to their accumulation in peripheral blood with subsequent suppression of systemic effector T cell expansion","identifiers":["oai:ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk:56102","10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310022"],"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"relations":["https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/56102/"],"repositories":[{"id":"124","openDoarId":0,"name":"University of East Anglia digital repository","uri":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"metadataRecordCount":0,"metadataDeletedRecordCount":0,"metadataLinkCount":0,"metadataSize":0,"journalMetadataSize":0,"metadataAge":null,"journalMetadataAge":null,"metadataInIndexCount":0,"metadataDeletedInIndexCount":0,"metadataAlloweInIndexCount":0,"metadataDisabledInIndexCount":0,"metadataExtractionDate":null,"journalMetadataExtractionDate":null,"databaseRecordCount":0,"databaseDeletedRecordCount":0,"databasePdfLinkCount":0,"databasePdfCount":0,"databaseDeletedPdfCount":0,"hardDrivePdfSize":0,"hardDrivePdfCount":0,"hardDriveDeletedPdfCount":0,"databaseTextCount":0,"databaseTextNotDeletedCount":0,"hardDriveTextCount":0,"hardDriveDeletedTextCount":0,"databaseIndexCount":0,"indexRecordCount":0,"indexJournalCount":0,"indexTextCount":0,"metadataOnlyIndex":0,"indexTextCountDB":0,"indexedPdfDB":0,"indexedDisabledDB":0,"indexTextNotDeletedCount":0,"hardDriveCitationFiles":0,"citationFilesDb":0,"crawlingLimit":0,"citationCount":0,"citationWithDocCount":0,"citationDoiCount":0,"documentDoiCount":0,"documentDoiWithFulltextCount":0,"repositoryLocation":null}],"subjects":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"title":"Differential effects of α4β7 and GPR15 on homing of effector and regulatory T cells from patients with UC to the inflamed gut in vivo","topics":[],"types":[],"year":2016,"fulltextUrls":["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/41991632.pdf","https://core.ac.uk/display/41991632","https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/56102/","https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/56102/3/Gut_2015_Fischer_gutjnl_2015_310022.pdf"],"fulltextIdentifier":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/41991632.pdf","doi":"10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310022","oai":"oai:ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk:56102"},{"id":"41993569","authors":["Stokes, Leanne","Mackenzie, Amanda","Sluyter, Ronald"],"contributors":[],"datePublished":"2016-02-15","identifiers":["oai:ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk:58053","10.3389/fimmu.2016.00048"],"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"relations":["https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/58053/"],"repositories":[{"id":"124","openDoarId":0,"name":"University of East Anglia digital repository","uri":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"metadataRecordCount":0,"metadataDeletedRecordCount":0,"metadataLinkCount":0,"metadataSize":0,"journalMetadataSize":0,"metadataAge":null,"journalMetadataAge":null,"metadataInIndexCount":0,"metadataDeletedInIndexCount":0,"metadataAlloweInIndexCount":0,"metadataDisabledInIndexCount":0,"metadataExtractionDate":null,"journalMetadataExtractionDate":null,"databaseRecordCount":0,"databaseDeletedRecordCount":0,"databasePdfLinkCount":0,"databasePdfCount":0,"databaseDeletedPdfCount":0,"hardDrivePdfSize":0,"hardDrivePdfCount":0,"hardDriveDeletedPdfCount":0,"databaseTextCount":0,"databaseTextNotDeletedCount":0,"hardDriveTextCount":0,"hardDriveDeletedTextCount":0,"databaseIndexCount":0,"indexRecordCount":0,"indexJournalCount":0,"indexTextCount":0,"metadataOnlyIndex":0,"indexTextCountDB":0,"indexedPdfDB":0,"indexedDisabledDB":0,"indexTextNotDeletedCount":0,"hardDriveCitationFiles":0,"citationFilesDb":0,"crawlingLimit":0,"citationCount":0,"citationWithDocCount":0,"citationDoiCount":0,"documentDoiCount":0,"documentDoiWithFulltextCount":0,"repositoryLocation":null}],"subjects":["Article","PeerReviewed"],"title":"Roles of ion channels in immune cells","topics":[],"types":[],"year":2016,"fulltextUrls":["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/41993569.pdf","https://core.ac.uk/display/41993569","https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/58053/","https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/58053/1/Roles_of_ion_channels_in_immune_cells.pdf"],"fulltextIdentifier":"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/41993569.pdf","doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2016.00048","oai":"oai:ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk:58053"},{"id":"25037172","authors":["Gelimson, Anatolij","Golestanian, Ramin"],"contributors":[],"datePublished":"2015-01-16","description":"The large scale behaviour of a population of cells that grow and interact\nthrough the concentration field of the chemicals they secrete is studied using\ndynamical renormalization group methods.

IL-27 is highly expressed during human tuberculosis (TB), and absence of IL-27R (Il27ra) specifically on T cells results in increased protection. IL-27R deficiency during chronic Mtb infection does not impact antigen-specific CD4+ T cell number but maintains programmed death-1 (PD-1), CD69, and CD127 expression while reducing T-bet and killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) expression. Furthermore, T-bet haploinsufficiency results in failure to generate KLRG1+, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, and in improved protection. T cells in Il27ra(-/-) mice accumulate preferentially in the lung parenchyma within close proximity to Mtb, and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells lacking IL-27R are intrinsically more fit than intact T cells and maintain IL-2 production. Improved fitness of IL-27R-deficient T cells is not associated with increased proliferation but with decreased expression of cell death-associated markers. Therefore, during Mtb infection, IL-27R acts intrinsically on T cells to limit protection and reduce fitness, whereas the IL-27R-deficient environment alters the phenotype and location of T cells. The significant expression of IL-27 in TB and the negative influence of IL-27R on T cell function demonstrate the pathway by which this cytokine/receptor pair is detrimental in TB.Peer-reviewedPublisher

The mechanism of HLMC adhesion to both cell types is only partly defined, and adhesion is not inhibited by function-blocking anti-Kit and anti-stem cell factor (SCF) antibodies. Our aim was to identify adhesion molecules expressed by human mast cells that mediate adhesion to human ASM cells (HASMCs) and human airway epithelial cells. METHODS: We used phage-display to isolate single chain Fv (scFv) antibodies with adhesion-blocking properties from rabbits immunised with HLMC and HMC-1 membrane proteins. RESULTS: Post-immune rabbit serum labelled HLMCs in flow cytometry and inhibited their adhesion to human BEAS-2B epithelial cells. Mast cell-specific scFvs were identified which labelled mast cells but not Jurkat cells by flow cytometry. Of these, one scFv (A1) consistently inhibited mast cell adhesion to HASMCs and BEAS-2B epithelial cells by about 30 %. A1 immunoprecipitated Kit (CD117) from HMC-1 lysates and bound to a human Kit-expressing mouse mast cell line, but did not interfere with SCF-dependent Kit signalling. CONCLUSION: Kit contributes to human mast cell adhesion to human airway epithelial cells and HASMCs, but may utilise a previously unidentified adhesion domain that lies outside the SCF binding site. Targeting this adhesion pathway might offer a novel approach for the inhibition of mast cell interactions with structural airway cells, without detrimental effects on Kit signalling in other tissues.Peer-reviewedPublisher

Cytokines such as IFNγ induce its expression in endothelial cells originating from immune-privileged sites. In this study, we investigate regulators of IDO in primary endothelial cells from a non-immune-privileged site and determine whether IDO expression affects immune cell behavior. METHODS: IDO expression was determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. IDO activity was estimated using an IDO enzyme assay. Primary cells were transfected using microporation, and T-cell migration was determined using a cell transmigration assay. RESULTS: IDO is expressed in human saphenous vein endothelial cells after stimulation with IFNγ but not after treatment with TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, or IL-10. VEGFβ and heparin negatively regulate IFNγ-driven increases in IDO. Overexpression of IDO in endothelial cells does not affect transmigration of T-cells. CONCLUSION: IDO is expressed in human saphenous vein endothelial cells after stimulation with IFNγ.

Here we have used the 661W cone photoreceptor cell line to ask whether exposure to the terminal complement complex C5b-9 induces cell death and/or modulates the sensitivity of these cells to other cellular stressors. 661W cone photoreceptors were exposed to complete normal human serum following antibody blockade of CD59. Apoptosis induction was assessed morphologically, by flow cytometry, and on western blotting by probing for cleaved PARP and activated caspase-3. Necroptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and Sirtuin 2 inhibition using 2-cyano-3-[5-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)-2-furyl]-N-5-quinolinylacrylamide (AGK2). The sensitivity of 661W cells to ionomycin, staurosporine, peroxide and chelerythrine was also investigated, with or without prior formation of C5b-9. 661W cells underwent apoptotic cell death following exposure to C5b-9, as judged by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 cleavage and activation of caspase-3. We also observed apoptotic cell death in response to staurosporine, but 661W cells were resistant to both ionomycin and peroxide. Interestingly, C5b-9 significantly increased 661W sensitivity to staurosporine-induced apoptosis and necroptosis. These studies show that low levels of C5b-9 on 661W cells can induce apoptosis, and that C5b-9 specifically sensitizes 661W cells to certain apoptotic and necroptotic pathways.

The associated health risks of α-particle exposure for lung cancer are well documented however the risk estimates for leukaemia remain uncertain. To further our understanding of α-particle effects in target cells for leukaemogenesis and also to seek general markers of individual exposure to α-particles, this study assessed the transmission of chromosomal damage initially-induced in human haemopoietic stem and progenitor cells after exposure to high-LET α-particles. Cells surviving exposure were differentiated into mature T-cells by extra-thymic T-cell differentiation in vitro. Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridisation (M-FISH) analysis of naïve T-cell populations showed the occurrence of stable (clonal) complex chromosome aberrations consistent with those that are characteristically induced in spherical cells by the traversal of a single α-particle track. Additionally, complex chromosome exchanges were observed in the progeny of irradiated mature T-cell populations. In addition to this, newly arising de novo chromosome aberrations were detected in cells which possessed clonal markers of α-particle exposure and also in cells which did not show any evidence of previous exposure, suggesting ongoing genomic instability in these populations. Our findings support the usefulness and reliability of employing complex chromosome exchanges as indicators of past or ongoing exposure to high-LET radiation and demonstrate the potential applicability to evaluate health risks associated with α-particle exposure.This work was supported by the Department of Health, UK.

However, an accurate and universal metric requires grid cell firing patterns to uniformly cover the space to be navigated, in contrast to recent demonstrations that environmental features such as boundaries can distort [9-11] and fragment [12] grid patterns. To establish whether grid firing is determined by local environmental cues, or provides a coherent global representation, we recorded mEC grid cells in rats foraging in an environment containing two perceptually identical compartments connected via a corridor. During initial exposures to the multicompartment environment, grid firing patterns were dominated by local environmental cues, replicating between the two compartments. However, with prolonged experience, grid cell firing patterns formed a single, continuous representation that spanned both compartments.

         * description : The complex interplay between cancer cells, stromal cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) regulates tumorigenesis and provides emerging targets for immunotherapies. Crosstalk between CD4(+) T cells and proliferating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) tumor B cells occurs within lymphoid tissue pseudo-follicles and investigating these interactions is essential to understand both disease pathogenesis and the effects of immunotherapy. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV) shedding is emerging as an important mode of intercellular communication in the TME. In order to characterize tumor EVs released in response to T cell-derived TME signals, we performed microRNA (miR) profiling of EVs released from CLL cells stimulated with CD40 and IL-4. Our results reveal an enrichment of specific cellular miRNAs including miR-363 within EVs derived from CD40/IL-4 stimulated CLL cells compared to parental cell miRNA content and control EVs from unstimulated CLL cells. We demonstrate that autologous patient CD4(+) T cells internalize CLL-EVs containing miR-363 that targets the immunomodulatory molecule CD69. We further reveal that autologous CD4(+) T cells that are exposed to EVs from CD40/IL-4 stimulated CLL cells exhibit enhanced migration, immunological synapse signaling and interactions with tumor cells. Knockdown of miR-363 in CLL cells prior to CD40/IL-4 stimulation, prevented the ability of CLL-EVs to induce increased synapse signaling and confer altered functional properties to CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, these data reveal a novel role for CLL-EVs in modifying T cell function that highlights unanticipated complexity of intercellular communication that may have implications for bidirectional CD4(+) T-cell:tumor interactions within the TME.Peer-reviewedPost-prin
